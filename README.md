# Vidweo Downwoadew

I searched high and low for a reliable video downloader, but to couldn't find any. That's when I had an idea - why not create my own? And that's exactly what I did.
With `Vidweo Downwoadew` you can easily download any video from `p*rnhub` without having to leave the site or worry about the reliability of third-party sources.

# Installation

To it, you will need to have the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension installed in your web browser. Once you have Tampermonkey installed, you can click the `extension icon` then click on `create a new script`. Then clear then `code editor` and paste this script.

Now every time you click on a video of THAT site, you will see a prompt asking you to make a selection of video resolution that you want to download.
